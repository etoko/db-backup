This is the README file for the db-backup script.

Simply add this file to your path and type it's name to start backup.

Adjust parameters such as encryption passphrase.

Encrypt this script using shc (www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~frosal) 
to hide the encryption passphrase and database password.

This script assumes that you use GNUPG (gpg) for encryption. You can always
change the encryption tool in the script.
